# Simulated Self Driving Car

# Overview
This is the code for training a machine learning model to drive a simulated car using Convolutional Neural Networks on Udacity's self driving car simulator.

# Steps:
1. Download Udacity's self driving car simulator from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim.
2. Download Anaconda.
3. On anaconda prompt: conda env create -f environments.yml
4. On anaconda prompt: go to the path of this project using cd. e.g. cd C:\Users\Sougat\Documents\GitHub\Self-Driving-Car-Simulator\Self Driving Car Project
5. On anaconda prompt: conda info --envs (find your env name with path)
6. On anaconda prompt: conda activate <env name with path> e.g. conda activate C:\Users\Sougat\.conda\envs\car-behavioral-cloning
7. On anaconda prompt: python drive.py
